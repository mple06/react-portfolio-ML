                        <p className="bio">Hi, I'm Minhvan. I am a former project manager turned full stack web developer. I recently earned a certificate from the University of Washington Coding Program, with newly developed skills in Javascript, CSS, Node.js, Express, React.js and much more.
                            As a project manager, I am a leader with strengths in communication and cultivating relationships. I have a strong ability to work independently as well as a team. I am also a strategic thinker and self-motivated individual able to manage several projects and perform under pressure in fast-paced, deadline-focused environments.
                            As a web developer, I am an innovative problem solver passionate about developing apps, with a focus on mobile-first design and development. Having skills in multiple facets of a business gives me a better understanding. Iâ€™m excited to leverage my skills as part of a rapid, quality-driven team to build better experiences for all.
                            Please feel free to check out my projects.</p>
